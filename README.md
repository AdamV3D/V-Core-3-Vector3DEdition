## General Change Goals
- improve printability especially for ABS. 
- printed parts to require no treatment after printing.

- Screw Hole diameter increased to be 0.5mm larger than Metric size. 
- Overhanging hole layer manipulation. 

## Print Settings
- Recommend ABS if possible, otherwise try Ooznest ABS Pro. Avoid esun abs+.

- 20-25% infill, gyroid or grid.
- 0.2mm layer height
- 0.4mm nozzle/line width
